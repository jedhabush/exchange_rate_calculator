# Simple Exchange_Rate_Calculator
This is a simple exchange rate calculator using a very simple API fetch method. This is one of my first projects that uses API requests. I found an API called **exchangerate-api** . It is very straight forward to use and the data is simple and organized. The purpose of this project was to familiarize myself with DOM manipulation as well as expose myself to how APIs work behind the scenes.

## Challenges
- DOM manipulaton was a bit of a challange. Designing HTML the right way was crucial to make your life easier when you call the elements using JS. 


## Future Improvements
- Enhance user interface
- Use reactJs instead of vanilla JS for scalability and sustainability
- Multiple devices responsiveness
